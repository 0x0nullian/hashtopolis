//TODO: check here if there is already a load.ini set which gives a good connection to a good sql server
// -> if there is a valid connection, check if we can determine the hashtopus tables...
//   -> if it's hashtopus original, we can run update script, create a new admin user and we are done
//   -> if its already a hashtopussy installation, we just can mark it as installed and check that there is an admin user
// -> if there is no valid connection, ask for the details
//   -> if valid details are given, run setup script, create admin user and done
