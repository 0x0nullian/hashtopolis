<div class='alert alert-neutral'>
	Hashtopussy is based on Hashtopus with some improvements and additional features included. Some of the
	differences to Hashtopus:<br>
	<ul>
		<li><b>User Management:</b> There is not a single user anymore which can do everything, an admin user
			can create new users with given rights to view/edit different parts in Hashtopussy</li>
		<li><b>File protection:</b> Files cannot be downloaded anymore just with the given path, even if the
			client which is accessing is not logged in and is not a Hashtopus client. This prevents someone
			just "steal" the files by downloading when he knows the url of Hashtopus.</li>
		<li><b>Supertasks:</b> Makes it possible to create multiple tasks at once for some basic runs.</li>
		<li><b>And a lot of other small features:</b> Auto-reload, automatic hex-salt, fixed salted found
			importing, agent owner, better password hashing, hashtype management, etc..
	</ul>
