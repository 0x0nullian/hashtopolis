# Hashtopussy 

This is a wrapper for hashcat for distributed hashcracking, based on the source code of Hashtopus. 

Notice: We decided to just publish Hashtopussy working with hashcat v3 and not focussing on also supporting the older versions. 
If you would like to use Hashtopussy with the older versions, please checkout commit cc3513b6e638beb0d70d75f44a2fbd0452c0ded7 where it was the state before adding hc v3 support.

Please visit the [wiki](https://bitbucket.org/seinlc/hashtopussy/wiki/Home) to get more information on setup and upgrade.
